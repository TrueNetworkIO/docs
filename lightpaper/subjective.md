title: Designing a Flexible Protocol for Subjective Reputation
description: This page explores the subjective nature of reputation, which makes it challenging to create a universal, one-size-fits-all algorithm. The True Network protocol is designed from the ground up to embrace this subjectivity, offering a solution that naturally addresses these complexities.

# Reputation is Subjective

**If Reputation is a subjective matter, then how can one build a protocol around it?**

Communities have their own value systems, considering different actions as more important for building reputation, making it very __subjective in nature__. Projects that mostly experimented with on-chain reputation are designed for specific types of communities or dApps, each with its own integration methods, documentation, and overhead. Therefore, __a single reputation system cannot meet the market's diverse needs__.

**True Network** addresses this by providing a composite protocol for easily building reputation algorithms using its SDKs and tools. Communities and dApps can utilize the existing set of algorithms that follow a consistent structure with minimal effort.

> True Network is not a reputation system; it’s a protocol for easily building any type of reputation system.

All attestations works as Proof of Work done on-chain, and can be passed via the [ACM](/lightpaper/protocol/reputation) at different angles resulting in the reputation that matters to a particular dapp.

True Network is a scalable, researched and upgradable protocol for building impactful on-chain reputation systems for the internet. This is made possible by leveraging Substrate & Polkadot (security) technology that runs wasm for algorithms in js (improving the devex) and supports higher math functions for reputation than anything possible on EVM. It’s the right fit for Web3, providing a solution not just for Polkadot, but for the entire internet.

True Network will be the Reputation Layer of the Internet.
