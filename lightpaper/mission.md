# Our Mission

Our vision with True Network is to bring accountability to anonymity in Web3. We strongly believe that reputation systems are the only solution for establishing a meritocratic system in this new, emerging web. This is a unique moment in the history of mankind where it is possible to build systems that are truly permissionless, transparent, and immutable. Therefore, it is essential to hold the most important information on-chain: reputation.

As we experiment with the Reputation Utility Module (RUM), we will venture into the territory of a true merit-based system, making **"Reputation an Asset."**
