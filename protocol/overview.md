# True Network's Protocol Overview

True Network is an on-chain reputation protocol that enables dApps to give users on-chain attestations and build reputation models based on their activities. It is one of the most feature-rich protocols, supporting all popular ecosystems, including EVM, Solana, and Polkadot.

## Web3 dApps are bleeding user’s retention, people don’t stay. 

In web2, we have built mechanisms to identify power-users, reward them & make them stay hooked into the application. There are many books written on the methodologies to do it including the best seller: Hooked by Nir Eyal.

On the other hand, web3 that is more capable in terms of technology fundamentals is missing a process / protocol that enables dApps to do it. 

> [!WARNING] According to the book:
> "Users stay hooked when products create a loop of triggers, actions, rewards, and investments." - Nir Eyal, Author of the book "Hooked".

Polkadot is one of the most technologically advanced frameworks today but still a lot of dApps die within weeks of launch because a protocol for user reputation is missing.

## On-Chain Reputation is the right-fit

It enables building Reputation Systems for the dApps to identify & reward their power users. Points cannot be bought from the market, only way is to earn them by doing work. Implementing such systems involves several steps, True Network can help build such model in a few minutes.

## Introducing True Network
**True Network** is a substrate-based on-demand parachain that enables dApps to give on-chain attestations to users for their work & deploy algorithms written in typescript that runs on the nodes as wasm modules to compute user reputation. 

It is designed with inspiration from the best practices for building reputation systems & provides features like reputation staking, aging, building reward curves, etc. out-of-the box.

This opens a whole lot of possible applications that can be built on top of it including on-chain games leveraging reputation scores for tournaments, DeFi for lending applications, social dApps for user retention & rewards, etc.
