# Why On-Chain Reputation?

Reputation System provides a better solution for user engagement & making them hooked :

- **Separates Financial Value from Signaling Value** <br/>
  Reputation separates signaling value from financial rewards given by projects.


- **Better Composability for Long-term Benefits** <br/>
  Reputation score is highly composable between protocols making them usable across chains & different types of projects. 


- **Hard to Earn Value, More Friction to Leave the Platform** <br/>
  Reputation provides provenance of work as compared to financial rewards and the scores can’t be bought from the market making them hard to earn.

> One excellent strategy to improve user retention is to incentivise users by rewarding them. It could be done in the form of coins, extra lives, discounts on in-app-purchase accessories, etc.
Through this kind of engagement, users feel valued and might stick around for longer. A dapp game such as Splinterlands provides daily rewards to its users.
