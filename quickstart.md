# Quickstart ⚡️

This is a development guide to quickstart building on top of True Network for on-chain attestations & reputation models using the Reputation CLI & SDK.

## How it works?
True Network provides the easy-to-use infrastructure for building blockchain-based reputation systems for the internet.

This SDK:
- Can be used in Next.JS / Node.JS
- Can be used to give on-chain attestations to users
- Can be used to write & deploy the algorithms to True Network's Testnet
- Connect to the True Network Nodes (Testnet / Mainnet)

## Setup a new project

To fast track the development process, we will be utilising `reputation-cli` to setup the true-network config in a new or existing project.

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

**Input**

````md
```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
````

**Output**

```js{4}
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      msg: 'Highlighted!'
    }
  }
}
```
